 * This is a modified implementation of the method for online estimation of kinematic structures described in our paper
 * "Online Interactive Perception of Articulated Objects with Multi-Level Recursive Estimation Based on Task-Specific Priors"
 * (Martín-Martín and Brock, 2014) and the extension to segment, reconstruct and track shapes introduced in our paper
 * "An Integrated Approach to Visual Perception of Articulated Objects" (Martín-Martín, Höfer and Brock, 2016)
 * This implementation can be used to reproduce the results of the paper and to be applied to new research.
 * The implementation allows also to be extended to perceive different information/models or to use additional sources of information.
 * A detail explanation of the method and the system can be found in our paper.
 *
 * If you are using this implementation in your research, please consider citing our work:
